					<p>A deep lover of the outdoors, recognizing nature’s innate ability to heal oneself, Liz has been tapping into these earth-healing powers since she was a young child. Playing sorceress in her back yard, and then growing up to be an avid wildcrafter of healing herbs, mushrooms etc. that grow as an offering from the earth to us. One of her greatest teachers being her dog, who consistently encourages her to get outside and meander, explore and play.</p>

					<p>Finding yoga was a great tool in deepening this connection to self, source and earth, thus Liz has been practicing consistently for almost a decade. Taking her teaching training in 2011 with <a href="http://www.yogaworks.com/en/teachertraining/faculty?staff_id=%7B075B9458-05BD-4485-A006-E5739E45EFE4%7D" target="_blank">Catherine Munro</a>, through Yogaworks, has served to further deepen her spiritual practice, by exploring the philosophies behind these ancient sacred traditions. She has now been teaching for over a year, which has again been agreat place to face personal fears, be vulnerable and inspire others to tap into their own wisdom and power.</p>

					<p>Recognizing the prevalence of stress in our society, and linking that to the epidemics of illness and disease in both body and mind, Liz has gravitated towards slower healing practices such as restorative yoga, which help us learn to relax and rest deeply and completely. She has completed a 40 hour restorative training with <a href="http://www.andreapeloso.com/" target="_blank">Andrea Peloso</a> which has given her greater skills and confidence to offer a truly healing space for her students.</p>

					<p>Liz has been intuitively using her hands to heal through touch and massage for most of her life. Finally acquiring formal training in the art of Thai Yoga Massage through <a href="http://www.lotuspalm.com/" target="_blank">Lotus Palm</a>, she is delighted to offer her skills in this craft. In this unique healing system of Thai Yoga Massage, the practitioner guides the client through a series of yoga postures, while palming and thumbing along the body’s energy (‘Sen’) lines and pressure points. Together these actions result in a comprehensive full body treatment that relieves muscular tension, improves circulation, boosts the immune system and balances the body energetically.</p>

					<p>Thai Yoga Massage is performed on a mat on the floor; both client and practitioner are dressed in comfortable clothing allowing ease of movement and flexibility.</p>

					<p>Recognizing we are all connected, Liz offers her services of healing, through yoga and massage, with a warm heart and gracious gratitude for this opportunity to share these gifts.</p>
